- ⚡ Fun fact:  
  I have worked on several impactful projects, such as:  
  - **Smart Dustbin System**: Using ESP32 and LoRaWAN, I built an IoT solution that monitors dustbin fill-levels and gas detection. It sends real-time alerts for efficient waste management and is powered by solar energy for eco-friendliness.  
  - **Borewell Automation System (KENCHUA)**: Developed an IoT-based remote control and monitoring system for agricultural borewell pumps using ESP32 and LoRa, helping farmers save water and electricity.  
  - **Mental Health AI Assistant (In Progress)**: Designing an AI virtual assistant that proactively detects stress and depression triggers by analyzing phone and wearable data, aiming to provide early mental health support.  
  - **DRDO Machine Learning Hardware Project**: Implemented ML models like SVM classifiers on FPGA (Verilog) combined with signal and image processing datasets for defense applications.  
  - **Time Series Forecasting & Preference Ranking**: Working on advanced ML techniques to improve prediction accuracy and AI-generated response quality for real-world use cases.  

  These projects blend hardware-software integration, AI/ML, and sustainable technology, reflecting my passion for creating solutions with real-world impact.
